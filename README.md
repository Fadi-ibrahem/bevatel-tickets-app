    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes tickets, replies. This can help you to quickly start testing the app or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

# Technicalities
 
This applications provides a ticket management system and mail tracking with a CRUD operations for tickets and replies in which every ticket has many replies, and there is a cabability to perform a cron job to submit a new ticket with a new fetched random message from an email inbox every one hour. system respectively send an acknowledge email message to the ticket email when ticket created, and sending a reply message within an email once new reply created on the ticket from the system.

This reached by performing:
 
- `Models` Represinting database talbes
- `Views` for displaying the html and the front-end on the browser
- `Controllers` to process the data and communicate between models and views
- `Repository` Design Pattern to separate between data source layer and business logic layer
- `Task Scheduling` to perform process every interval of time
- `events` to uppon do some actions
- `listeners` to listen to events and perform methods
- `jobs` to execute something in the background
- `Mails` to send emails
- `Services` to avoid huge code from controllers
- `factoreis` to generate data in database
- `seeders` to seed dummy data
